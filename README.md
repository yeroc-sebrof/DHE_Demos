# DHE_Demos
Code that demos the concepts of a Diffie-Hellman(-Merkle) exchange for a networking paper

The only copy was in a PDF. For the sake of long term saving it has been moved here

This code should only be used for education purposes to grasp the concepts

*If you run example 2 be aware it has only ever ran over 127.0.0.1 before and server must be run first*
